# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
r^2 is the "coefficient of determination" it shows how well the model fits the data
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
136.52
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think the model isnt very accurate while it might get a good estimate you could use more variables about the person like weight or other factors to get a more accurate number.
